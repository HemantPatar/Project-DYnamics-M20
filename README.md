# Project-DYnamics-M20
Evaluation projects.
Instructions---follow the steps.
1.     Do the careful EDA analysis.
2.     Use standard techniques (PCA, Scaling, encoding, underfitting/overfitting, AUCROC curve, cross-validation, grid search, ensemble)
        wherever applicable.
3.     Make the documentation and write your findings in the same file.ipynb
4.     Try to achieve Accuracy of more than  90%
5.     Use all the supported metrics 
6.     Store the predicted results in the CSV file.
7.     Test multiple models on the same dataset and Explain that on what basis you have selected the particular model as a final model.
9.     Save the best model for production.
10.   Create your GitHub account. Create a public repository on GitHub, upload solution .ipynb files in the repository.
